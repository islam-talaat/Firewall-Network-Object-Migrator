# Firewall-Network-Object-Migrator
FMC, Paloalto and Fortigate Network Object migrator

the main Idea of this project is to migrate Network objects between Paloalto or Cisco FMC (Firepower Management Center) or even from an Excel Sheet to each otherâ€™s.

sometimes the customer has two firewalls from different vendors and it might be necessary to replicate the objects with the same name.
this project was my entry point to Automation and APIs...
